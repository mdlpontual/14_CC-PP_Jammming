# Jammming (with Spotify) 
## Create, edit, and listen to your playlists in a more streamlined way. 

### This is a practice project for the Codecademy front-end course. 

**This web application allows the user to search Spotify's library to create and edit new or existing playlists off-platform, then save them to the user's account.**  
The scope of this exercise asks us to create a simple web application that uses Spotify's APIs to create custom playlists outside the official platform.  
Because I am a long-term Spotify user, I saw an opportunity to use this project as a real-world scenario for a useful application that could improve the streaming platform's user experience.

The OEM platform presents the following main UI/UX issues:
* The inability to simultaneously view two lists on the screen (a playlist and the search results, for instance);
* The laborious path needed for any interaction (addition, edit, or removal) between tracks and playlists, which requires multiple-stage navigation through option lists for every single action;
* The lack of options to control playing tracks with keyboard arrows and shortcuts.

<br/>

The primary goals of this project are:
* Build a UI showing two containers at all times, one for displaying playlists and another for search results, so that the user can see in real-time any modifications to their playlists;
* Make the interactions between tracks and playlists as effortless as possible by reducing the number of clicks the user needs to make to add, edit, share, or remove content;
* Create the same easy-to-use experience for editing and creating playlists;
* Embed a track player so the user can listen to the content, but with a more comprehensive range of controls.
