# ezJam (with Spotify) 
## Create, edit, and listen to your playlists in a more streamlined way. 

**This web application was commissioned by a part-time DJ that needed a tool to help him customize his Spotify playlists off-platform while improving a few points of the user experience catered to his specific needs.**

The client is an electrician who works with photovoltaic system installations during the week, but performs as a DJ at parties on weekends as a hobby, attending mostly birthday parties and small weddings in the countryside. He has been doing this since the 1990s and has used all types of gear technology over the years. Nowadays he has condensed most of his equipment to a laptop, a pair of quality speakers, a portable mixing table, and a Spotify premium account.

Within his Spotify account, he collects a variety of pre-made, battle-tested playlists that he has been building for years, and for every different gig he plays, he always creates new playlists based on the taste and requests of the specific client of the night. Despite being a hobby, preparing these playlists requires him to mix his own collection of tracks with the client's requests and the "adjustments" on the fly during the gig. So he needs an application that helps him prepare for these events alongside the main Spotify application.

The main objective of this new application is to improve the experience of customizing and modifying his playlists outside of the job by solving an old issue that he always had with Spotify's user experience: the fact that you can't see the content of the user's playlists and the searched results from the Spotify library on the same screen side by side. The second objective is to have an off-platform tool to assist and back up the main app during events. He will keep using the official Spotify application installed on his laptop as the main tool for playing and visualizing tracks during gigs.

Scope of the project:
* The app needs to work separately and independently from the main Spotify app;
* Build the UI in a way that the client can see the content of his playlists on the same screen as the search results from Spotify's library, at all times and side by side;
* Imitate the same basic mechanisms and functionalities of the Spotify app;
* Have a built-in track player;
* Have vibrant colors with excellent contrast so it pops on the screen when playing in dark rooms while also helping differentiate from the Spotify app in dark mode when using both at the same time;
* Allow full control of the customizations by saving or discarding changes to playlists before they are updated permanently;
* Upload the changes to his playlists automatically and quickly, so he can play or modify them at will and live.

He doesn't need the app to be installed on his laptop or smartphone, so a web application using the Spotify Web API was the selected option for the development of this project. He preferred the option of opening this app with a browser so he could use it as a backup for playing the tracks in case the main app installed crashes on the fly.

The application is in development and Spotify restricts access to the public.
